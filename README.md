# Data Contract Specification

![datacontract.png](images/datacontract.png)

Data contracts bring data providers and data consumers together.

**General Overview**
What are Data Contracts?
_Data contracts_ are similar to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) but pertain to data. They are agreements between a service provider and data consumers regarding the management and intended usage of data. The goal is to ensure reliable and high-quality data that all parties can trust.

A _data contract_ is a document that defines the structure, format, semantics, quality, and terms of use for exchanging data between a data provider and their consumers. A data contract is implemented by a data product's output port or other data technologies. Data contracts can also be used for the input port to specify the expectations of data dependencies and verify given guarantees.

The _data contract specification_ defines a YAML format to describe attributes of provided data sets. It is data platform neutral, yet supports well-known formats to express schemas (e.g., dbt models, JSON Schema, Protobuf, SQL DDL) and quality tests (e.g., SodaCL, SQL queries) to avoid unnecessary abstractions. The data contract specification is an open initiative to define a common data contract format. Think of an [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/), but for data sets.

Data contracts come into play when data is exchanged between different teams or organizational units, such as in a [data mesh architecture](https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/). 
First, and foremost, data contracts are a communication tool to express a common understanding of how data should be structured and interpreted. They make semantic and quality expectations explicit. Later in development and production, they also serve as the basis for code generation, testing, schema validations, quality checks, monitoring, access control, and computational governance policies.

_Note: The term "data contract" refers to a specification that is usually owned by the data provider and thus does not align with a "contract" in a legal sense as a mutual agreement between two parties. The term "contract" may be somewhat misleading, but it is how it is used in practice. The mutual agreement between one data provider and one data consumer is the "data usage agreement" that refers to a data contract. Data usage agreements have a defined lifecycle, start/end date, and help the data provider to track who accesses their data and for which purposes._

The specification is inspired by [AIDA User Group's Open Data Contract Standard](https://github.com/AIDAUserGroup/open-data-contract-standard), (formerly [PayPal's Data Contract Template](https://github.com/paypal/data-contract-template/blob/main/docs/README.md)) and Data Mesh Manager's [Data Contract API](https://www.datamesh-manager.com). 
It follows [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) and [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) conventions.

Why are Data Contracts Needed?
Data teams often rely on systems that produce data. However, software engineers managing these systems might not be aware of data dependencies. Changes they make can crash dependent data systems. Data contracts can enforce specific formats, constraints, and meanings to prevent such issues. They help data producers and consumers align, especially in a distributed data environment.

**Contents of a Data Contract**
Data contracts can be simple and focus on effective implementation. They might cover:
1. Data being extracted
2. Ingestion type and frequency
3. Data ownership details
4. Levels of data access required
5. Security and governance information
6. Impact on systems due to ingestion

Responsibility for Data Contracts:
**The decision to use data contracts typically lies with data leaders. However, all stakeholders involved in data consumption should have input. Data consumers benefit the most, while data producers might need convincing about the benefits.

When to Implement Data Contracts:
While it might seem best to implement data contracts as soon as possible, it's essential to have stable data pipelines first. If an organization is moving towards a data mesh approach, it might be an ideal time to introduce data contracts.

Future of Data Contracts:
As organizations adopt a data mesh approach, data contracts become more crucial. They are still relatively new and might evolve in the future to address challenges arising from unexpected schema changes.

**Frequently Asked Questions**
What formats are typically used for data contracts?
Data contracts are often written in templated interactive data languages (IDL) such as Apache Avro or JSON.

How do data contracts prevent schema-related issues?
Data contracts define and enforce the schema and meaning of the data being produced. This ensures that any changes to the data's structure or format are communicated and agreed upon, preventing unexpected breaks in downstream processes.

Are data contracts similar to APIs?
Yes, in a way. A data contract operates in a transparent and versionable manner, similar to how an API facilitates the reliable exchange of information between applications.

Can data contracts be used externally?
While most data contract architectures are designed for internal data operations, they can also be part of external data sharing initiatives.

How do data contracts decouple data architecture?
Data contracts provide a mechanism to avoid using production data or change data capture (CDC) events directly, ensuring that changes in one system don't inadvertently impact another.

What's an example of a data contract implementation?
One effective implementation was by Andrew Jones at GoCardless. The contract is in Jsonette, merged to Git by the data owner. Dedicated BigQuery and PubSub resources are then automatically deployed and populated with the requested data via a Kubernetes cluster and a custom self-service infrastructure platform called Utopia.

How do data contracts relate to data mesh initiatives?
If a team is pursuing any data mesh initiative, it's an ideal time to ensure data contracts are a part of it. Data mesh approaches often involve distributed data responsibilities, making contracts essential for clarity and reliability.

How often do data contracts need updating?
Data contracts are typically fairly evergreen. Aside from occasional version control tweaks and updates to contact details, they don't require frequent changes once established.

### Schema Object

The schema of the data contract describes the syntax and semantics of provided data sets. 
As the type of the output port depends on the data platform, multiple schema specifications are supported.

A schema may define a single table, a collection of tables as a dataset, a file structure, or any arbitrary structure.

To avoid unnecessary abstractions, the data contract specification supports existing well-known formats. Some schema types, such as `dbt`, also support defining tests and additional metadata.

        description: "My description"
        columns:
          - name: "My column"
            data_type: text
            description: "My description"
```

Example (string):

```yaml
schema:
  type: dbt
  specification: |-
    version: 2
    models:
      - name: "My Table"
        description: "My description"
        columns:
          - name: "My column"
            data_type: text
            description: "My description"
```

#### BigQuery Schema Object

The schema structure is defined by the [Google BigQuery Table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables#resource:-table) object. You can extract such a Table object via the [tables.get](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/get) endpoint.

Instead of providing a single Table object, you can also provide an array of such objects. Be aware that [tables.list](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/list) only returns a subset of the full Table object. You need to call every Table object via [tables.get](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/get) to get the full Table object, including the actual schema.

Example:

```yaml
schema:
  type: bigquery
  specification: |-
    {
      "tableReference": {
        "projectId": "my-project",
        "datasetId": "my_dataset",
        "tableId": "my_table"
      },
      "description": "This is a description",
      "type": "TABLE",
      "schema": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "name",
            "type": "STRING",
            "mode": "NULLABLE",
            "description": "This is a description"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
```

#### JSON Schema Schema Object

JSON Schema can be defined as JSON or rendered as YAML, following the [OpenAPI Schema Object dialect](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#properties)

Example (inline YAML):

```yaml
schema:
  type: json-schema
  specification:
    orders:
      description: One record per order. Includes cancelled and deleted orders.
      type: object
      properties:
        order_id:
          type: string
          description: Primary key of the orders table
        order_timestamp:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: The business timestamp in UTC when the order was successfully registered in the source system and the payment was successful.
        order_total:
          type: integer
          description: Total amount of the order in the smallest monetary unit (e.g., cents).
    line_items:
      type: object
      properties:
        lines_item_id:
          type: string
          description: Primary key of the lines_item_id table
        order_id:
          type: string
          description: Foreign key to the orders table
        sku:
          type: string
          description: The purchased article number
```

Example (string):

```yaml
schema:
  type: json-schema
  specification: |-
    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "orders": {
          "type": "object",
          "description": "One record per order. Includes cancelled and deleted orders.",
          "properties": {
            "order_id": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "Primary key of the orders table"
            },
            "order_timestamp": {
              "type": "string",
              "format": "date-time",
              "description": "The business timestamp in UTC when the order was successfully registered in the source system and the payment was successful."
            },
            "order_total": {
              "type": "integer",
              "description": "Total amount of the order in the smallest monetary unit (e.g., cents)."
            }
          },
          "required": ["order_id", "order_timestamp", "order_total"]
        },
        "line_items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "lines_item_id": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "Primary key of the lines_item_id table"
            },
            "order_id": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "Foreign key to the orders table"
            },
            "sku": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "The purchased article number"
            }
          },
          "required": ["lines_item_id", "order_id", "sku"]
        }
      },
      "required": ["orders", "line_items"]
    }
```

#### SQL DDL Schema Object

Classical SQL DDLs can be used to describe the structure.


Example (string):

```yaml
schema:
  type: sql-ddl
  specification: |-
      -- One record per order. Includes cancelled and deleted orders.
      CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- Primary key of the orders table
        order_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL, -- The business timestamp in UTC when the order was successfully registered in the source system and the payment was successful.
        order_total INTEGER NOT NULL -- Total amount of the order in the smallest monetary unit (e.g., cents)
      );
    
      -- The items that are part of an order
      CREATE TABLE line_items (
        lines_item_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, -- Primary key of the lines_item_id table
        order_id TEXT REFERENCES orders(order_id), -- Foreign key to the orders table
        sku TEXT NOT NULL -- The purchased article number
      );

```

#### SodaCL Quality Object

Quality attributes in [Soda Checks Language](https://docs.soda.io/soda-cl/soda-cl-overview.html).

The `specification` represents the content of a `checks.yml` file.

Example (inline):

```yaml
quality:
  type: SodaCL   # data quality check format: SodaCL, montecarlo, dbt-tests, custom
  specification: # expressed as string or inline yaml or via "$ref: checks.yaml"
    checks for orders:
      - row_count > 0
      - duplicate_count(order_id) = 0
    checks for line_items:
      - row_count > 0
```

Example (string):

```yaml
quality:
  type: SodaCL
  specification: |-
    checks for search_queries:
      - freshness(search_timestamp) < 1d
      - row_count > 100000
      - missing_count(search_query) = 0
```

#### Monte Carlo Quality Object

Quality attributes defined as Monte Carlos [Monitors as Code](https://docs.getmontecarlo.com/docs/monitors-as-code).

The `specification` represents the content of a `montecarlo.yml` file.

Example (string):

```yaml
quality:
  type: montecarlo
  specification: |-
    montecarlo:
      field_health:
        - table: project:dataset.table_name
          timestamp_field: created
      dimension_tracking:
        - table: project:dataset.table_name
          timestamp_field: created
          field: order_status
```

### Specification Extensions

While the Data Contract Specification tries to accommodate most use cases, additional data can be added to extend the specification at certain points.

A custom fields can be added with any name. The value can be null, a primitive, an array or an object.
